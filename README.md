# HealthFusion An All-in-One AI-Medical Solution
HealthFusion has identified a critical business problem, which is the lack of accessibility and timely detection of multiple diseases. The traditional approach of detecting diseases is time-consuming, expensive, and not accessible to everyone, especially in remote areas. This problem can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can have serious consequences for patients.

The proposed solution, HealthFusion, is novel and practical as it offers a comprehensive solution to detect multiple diseases using the power of AI. HealthFusion is a user-friendly app that can be accessed from the comfort of homes, making it accessible to everyone. The use of advanced technologies such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Random Forest, and XGBoost allows for accurate and timely detection of diseases, leading to better patient outcomes.

# Tools and Technologies
*Python - Jupyter Notebook (TensorFlow for Model Training)
*Flask Web Framework (for Backend)
*Google Firebase (for Real-Time Storage and Firestore Database)
*HTML, CSS, and JS (for Frontend)
*Ai Powered chatbot Support (Openai / Gemini Advance API)

# Runtime
*Python v3.8.10

# Dataset
The dataset for the project was gathered from multiple sources. Two of them are as follows:

Chest X-ray images (1000 images) were obtained from: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
CT Scan images (750 images) were obtained from: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT/tree/master/Data-split
80% of the images were used for training the models and the remaining 20% for testing.

# Whats New

**What's next for HealthFusion**

HealthFusion has ambitious plans for the future. The platform aims to expand its disease detection capabilities by adding more diseases that can be detected using X-ray scans or by inputting simple numbers. The platform also plans to provide patients with information about the precautions they need to take and how they can cure themselves if they test positive for a particular disease. Additionally, HealthFusion plans to store detection records to help doctors monitor patients' health and track their progress. The team also plans to refine the platform's revenue model as they gather feedback from users and continue to grow and expand their business. Overall, HealthFusion aims to continue disrupting the healthcare industry by providing an accessible and convenient medical solution that leverages the power of technology.
